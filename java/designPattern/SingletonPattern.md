Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

###Implementation
We're going to create a SingleObject class. SingleObject class have its constructor as private and have a static instance of itself.

SingleObject class provides a static method to get its static instance to outside world. SingletonPatternDemo, our demo class will use SingleObject class to get a SingleObject object.


1. Create a Singleton Class.

SingleObject.java

Volatile is a must:
1. Allocate uniqueInstance space
2. Initialize uniqueInstance
3. Point uniqueInstance to allocated address

JVM instruction rearrangement
```
public class SingleObject {
    private volatile static Singleton uniqueInstance;
    private Singleton() {
    }

    public static Singleton getUniqueInstance() {
        if (uniqueInstance == null) {
            //类对象加锁
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (uniqueInstance == null) {
                    uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return uniqueInstance;
    }
}
```
2. Get the only object from the singleton class.

SingletonPatternDemo.java
```
public class SingletonPatternDemo {
   public static void main(String[] args) {

      //illegal construct
      //Compile Time Error: The constructor SingleObject() is not visible
      //SingleObject object = new SingleObject();

      //Get the only object available
      SingleObject object = SingleObject.getInstance();

      //show the message
      object.showMessage();
   }
}
```
